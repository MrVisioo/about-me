                <p> Candle making and burning simulator. Inspired by Let's create! Pottery this game adds it own twist
                    allowing to destroy finished creations. </p>
                <p> Candles simulator was made in collaboration with local candle artist and is used in cross-media
                    marketing campaign. </p>
                <p> Candles simulator is made in an overall low-fi aesthetic. UI design, low-poly models and
                    low-resolution textures are used to bring a sense of home and nostalgia. A metaphor for the natural
                    warmth of the candle. </p>
                <p> Use your mouse cursor an a variety of settings to shape the candle to your liking. Save it for a
                    rainy day or watch it burn. </p>

                <p> PiggyX is a gift-card of game, a christmas present. The objective of the game is to decorate a

                <p> Krab Island is an experience of living on a desert island. Unique art style and environment details
                    are fun to look at while you hunt the crabs for a meal. </p>
                <p>Krab Island soundtrack is instrumental ambient performed on sitar and singing bowl, which further
                    amplifies the aesthetic.</p>
                <p>Krab Island is an ode to the lazy hot summer day.</p>

                <p> Durak-Online, was created in response to a need for a simple online platform for playing Durak card
                    game. Other available solutions required complicated setup processes, so I took it upon myself to
                    create a user-friendly option. With numerous successful Durak-Online sites currently in existence,
                    there is certainly a market for it. </p>
                <p> Although nothing in this project itself was particularly complex, the real-time nature of an online
                    real-time game necessitated some shift in concepts. My focus was scalability and minimal latency.
                </p>
                <p> The creation of the frontend for this project was an enjoyable experience. Having previously worked
                    with Flutter, I chose to use it again. Durak Online being my biggest Flutter project yet, I'm
                    satisfied with the competitive look and feel that I managed to design and create.</p>

                <p> The Smith And The Devil is a game about the beauty of material science, of working with metal. A
                    game about dark force lending the power to shape stone for the reason to subdue human soul into a
                    place of suffering. Or maybe it was all just a dream... Brought from the toxic fumes of the
                    blacksmith trade. </p>
                <p> A high concept piece at the design stage The Smith And The Devil currently exists as a freely
                    available demo. </p>

                    <figcaption>That's a style!</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p> War Of Kyborg is an early experiment in game development and software development for me overall.
                    It's inspired with ascii rogue-like titles such as ADOM and Dwarf Fortress. </p>
                <p> War Of Kyborg is turn-based hot-sit two-player game. Each player takes control of a
                    Kyborg<sup>tm</sup> (a robot really). The Kyborgs are powerful beings able to punch through rock,
                    which is one of the game objectives, but they cannot swim in water. </p>
                <p> Players must collect stone to build infrastructure: fortifications, roads, stairs. Everything that
                    can help them defend against the inevitable enemy attack. </p>
                <p> Developed on and off between years 2012-2016 it came through multiple iterations of complete
                    rewrites in Pascal, Delphi and C++. Some fun features include the ability to weaponize infinite
                    loops against the opponent. </p>
