                <p> Durak-Online is an online platform designed to cater to the need for a simple and user-friendly
                    solution for playing the Durak card game. Unlike other existing solutions that require extensive
                    setup processes and registration, Durak-Online provides a hassle-free gaming experience that can be
                    started within seconds. </p>
                <p>Although the game mechanics were not particularly complex, the real-time nature of an online game
                    required careful consideration of scalability and minimal latency. With numerous successful
                    Durak-Online sites currently in operation, it is clear that there is a strong demand for this type
                    of platform. </p>
                <p>Leveraging my prior experience with Flutter, I was able to create a competitive look and feel for
                    Durak-Online. As my biggest Flutter project to date, I am satisfied with the result and the unique
                    design elements that I incorporated. </p>

                <p> PiggyX is a simple toy about chasing the pigs. You see, they stole the tree decorations, so no
                    celebration until they're caught. Also featuring original holiday tunes composed by me.</p>

                <p> Krab Island is a digital vacation. Chase the crabs while the banger of a soundtrack is playing. Spot
                    the birds while you're warming by the fire. </p>
                <p> Krab Island is a joyful experience, where the joy was making it. You might appreciate the art that
                    went into the sprites and the music.</p>

                </figure>
                <p> Candles Simulator is a unique game that lets you shape and burn candles to your heart's content.
                    Inspired by the popular game "Let's Create! Pottery", this game has its unique twist: you can
                    destroy your finished creations! </p>
                <p> The Candle Simulator has been created in collaboration with a local candle artist and is part of a
                    cross-media marketing campaign. We aimed to create a low-fi aesthetic using simple UI designs,
                    low-poly models, and low-resolution textures to evoke a sense of home and nostalgia. This aesthetic
                    serves as a metaphor for the natural warmth of candles. </p>
                <p> With the help of your mouse cursor and a range of settings, you can shape your candle however you
                    like. You can save it for a rainy day or sit back and watch it burn. </p>

                </figure>
                <p> The Smith And The Devil is a game about the beauty of material science. The concept revolves around
                    the dark force living in the blacksmith forge. It lends its power to our protagonist, in hope of one
                    day subduing their soul. Your goal is to balance between a profitable business and going insane and
                    jumping into the forge.</p>

                    <figcaption>That's a style!</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p> War Of Kyborg is a turn-based hot-sit two-player game. Each player takes control of a robot,
                    possessing the power to punch through rock and build structures out of it.</p>
                <p> Players need to destroy the opposition. Robots can't swim, and if you can lure the opponent into a
                    river that would be detrimental. Another idea is to build a circle of conveyors, where the infinite
                    loop will surely disable any robot. Or simply drop yourself from a high place like a projectile.</p>
                <p> War Of Kyborg was the original entry into software development for me. After devouring all of the
                    Pascal coding manuals in the local library, I needed something more challenging than text-based
                    calculators.</p>
