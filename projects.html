                <p> Durak-Online is an online platform designed to cater to the need for a simple and user-friendly
                    solution for playing the Durak card game. Unlike other existing solutions that require extensive
                    setup processes and registration, Durak-Online provides a hassle-free gaming experience that can be
                    started within seconds. </p>
                <p>Although the game mechanics were not particularly complex, the real-time nature of an online game
                    required careful consideration of scalability and minimal latency. With numerous successful
                    Durak-Online sites currently in operation, it is clear that there is a strong demand for this type
                    of platform. </p>
                <p>Leveraging my prior experience with Flutter, I was able to create a competitive look and feel for
                    Durak-Online. As my biggest Flutter project to date, I am satisfied with the result and the unique
                    design elements that I incorporated. </p>

                <h2 class="project-header">Yogurt Company B2B store</h2>
                <p> The yogurt company tasked our team with optimizing its current business processes, specifically
                    addressing the complex wholesale distribution system. The system required a significant amount of
                    manual input, back-and-forth communication, and large Excel tables, as wholesale clients would
                    request product information via email, and sales managers had to connect to the headquarters using
                    VNC to access inventory. </p>
                <p> In response we developed a comprehensive solution that streamlined these processes. We designed and
                    integrated a remote server with the inventory management system and developed apps for all available
                    platforms. Our solution simplified the process for wholesale clients, making it easier to order
                    shipments and relieving sales managers from managing these tasks manually. </p>
                <p> Overall, our solution optimized the company's business processes, increased efficiency, and improved
                    customer satisfaction and profitability. </p>

                <p> PiggyX is a simple toy about chasing the pigs. You see, they stole the tree decorations, so no
                    celebration until they're caught. Also featuring original holiday tunes composed by me.</p>

                <p> As part of a research team, our goal was to develop software that could simulate forest fires, in
                    collaboration with a local fire department, that was interested in identifying the most effective
                    firefighting methods supported by mathematical models. </p>
                <p> Using our collective expertise, we were able to successfully create an approximate simulation of
                    various types of forest fires, including ground fires and crown fires, along with several
                    firefighting methods such as firetrucks and aerial firefighting. </p>

                <p> Krab Island is a digital vacation. Chase the crabs while the banger of a soundtrack is playing. Spot
                    the birds while you're warming by the fire. </p>
                <p> Krab Island is a joyful experience, where the joy was making it. You might appreciate the art that
                    went into the sprites and the music.</p>

                </figure>
                <p> Candles Simulator is a unique game that lets you shape and burn candles to your heart's content.
                    Inspired by the popular game "Let's Create! Pottery", this game has its unique twist: you can
                    destroy your finished creations! </p>
                <p> The Candle Simulator has been created in collaboration with a local candle artist and is part of a
                    cross-media marketing campaign. We aimed to create a low-fi aesthetic using simple UI designs,
                    low-poly models, and low-resolution textures to evoke a sense of home and nostalgia. This aesthetic
                    serves as a metaphor for the natural warmth of candles. </p>
                <p> With the help of your mouse cursor and a range of settings, you can shape your candle however you
                    like. You can save it for a rainy day or sit back and watch it burn. </p>

                </figure>
                <p> The Smith And The Devil is a game about the beauty of material science. The concept revolves around
                    the dark force living in the blacksmith forge. It lends its power to our protagonist, in hope of one
                    day subduing their soul. Your goal is to balance between a profitable business and going insane and
                    jumping into the forge.</p>

                    <h2 class="project-header">Py-Cubes</h2>
                </a>
                <p> This project is a Python-based 3D engine that started as a series of experiments exploring 3D
                    rendering. I began by projecting 3D shapes and then attempted to learn OpenGL. Soon when I
                    discovered the ModernGL library and was immediately intrigued. Using the tutorial on learnopengl.com
                    as my guide, I developed a basic 3D engine in Python and ModernGL and made modifications to expand
                    functionality and make its use more Pythonic. </p>
                <p>Although Python is not an ideal language for game development, I'm curious to create a full-featured
                    game engine using this 3D engine. Writing shaders and developing 3D code using matrices and vectors
                    was a thrilling experience, as linear algebra is something I enjoy a lot. </p>

                    <figcaption>That's a style!</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p> War Of Kyborg is a turn-based hot-sit two-player game. Each player takes control of a robot,
                    possessing the power to punch through rock and build structures out of it.</p>
                <p> Players need to destroy the opposition. Robots can't swim, and if you can lure the opponent into a
                    river that would be detrimental. Another idea is to build a circle of conveyors, where the infinite
                    loop will surely disable any robot. Or simply drop yourself from a high place like a projectile.</p>
                <p> War Of Kyborg was the original entry into software development for me. After devouring all of the
                    Pascal coding manuals in the local library, I needed something more challenging than text-based
                    calculators.</p>
